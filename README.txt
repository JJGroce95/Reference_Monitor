CSCE 3550 Project 1

For compilation
1) upload all project 1 files to same folder along with your instruction list
2) open terminal and set file directory to that folder
	ie. cd 'Project 1'
3) type 'make' to activate the makefile
4) type './secureblp instrList' or whatever your instruction list file is
	note: the instruction list file extension HAS to be a lowercase .txt
	I hardcoded the file extension '.txt' into the program.
5) the program should run
6) use make clean to remove the .o file. An error message will display but it'll still work.
